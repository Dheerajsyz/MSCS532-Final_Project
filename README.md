# High-Performance Computing Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project implements and analyzes cache optimization techniques for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. The implementation demonstrates practical cache-aware programming principles based on empirical research findings from "An Empirical Study of High Performance Computing (HPC) Performance Bugs."

## Selected Optimization Technique

**Cache-aware memory access optimization** was selected because:
- Memory-related issues account for 40% of HPC performance problems
- Cache misses can cause 100-1000x performance penalties
- Cache optimization provides measurable improvements across diverse applications
- The technique demonstrates fundamental HPC optimization principles

## Implementation

The project consists of a single, comprehensive demonstration script that showcases two key optimization areas:

### 1. Array Operations Optimization
- **Cache-friendly approach**: In-place array reversal with sequential memory access
- **Cache-unfriendly approach**: New array creation with random access patterns
- **Results**: 8-12% performance improvement through better cache utilization

### 2. Matrix Multiplication Optimization  
- **Naive approach**: Python lists with poor memory access patterns
- **Optimized approach**: NumPy arrays with vectorized operations
- **Results**: 100-5000x performance improvement through vectorization and cache optimization

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the demonstration:
   ```bash
   python hpc_optimization_demo.py
   ```

3. View results:
   - Performance metrics displayed in terminal
